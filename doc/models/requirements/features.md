# Hypermarkdown — Top 10 Features

**Status:** Derived from `initial_sketch.md` (Draft v0.1)
**Method:** Ranked by the source document's own emphasis (explicit callouts like
"the primary differentiator," "the keystone feature") plus cross-cutting
importance — features that other requirements depend on outrank standalone
syntax items.

---

1. **Namespace-scoped link resolution** (req 46–51, §7)
   Folders are namespaces, not decoration. `[[login]]` resolves nearest-first
   (same folder, then up toward root); ambiguity is a hard error, never a
   guess. Called out in the source as **"the primary differentiator"** —
   everything else in the format assumes this exists.

2. **Wikilinks, embeds, and block-level addressing** (req 1–8)
   `[[Page]]`, `[[Page#Section]]`, `[[Page#^id]]`, and their `!`-prefixed
   embed forms. The base composition primitive everything else (templates,
   queries, transclusion) builds on top of.

3. **Parameterized transclusion / templates** (req 20, 79–86, §10)
   `{{template|arg=value}}` on Jinja2, with query-result iteration (82) and
   "Topic" as a first-class template+query+namespace unit (86). Labeled
   directly in the source as **"the keystone feature."**

4. **Query language with materialization** (req 34–41, §9)
   Dataview-style `FROM`/predicate queries, but results are written back into
   the file as a fenced block (40) rather than existing only at render time —
   explicitly fixing the flaw that spawned Obsidian's separate "Dataview
   Serializer" plugin.

5. **`hmd lint`** (req 63, §19)
   The only v0 command: parse, resolve, report. Chosen as the sequencing
   anchor because it's useful before rendering, queries, or templates exist —
   lets the format be adopted one file at a time.

6. **LSP as the spine, single Python implementation** (§15)
   `hmd lsp` backs the CLI, the MkDocs build, and the VS Code extension
   through one grammar. No second implementation to drift out of sync — the
   architectural decision that makes P5 ("one implementation") real rather
   than aspirational.

7. **VS Code live preview** (req 87–97, §14)
   Scroll-synced rendered/graph/mind-map views in a sidebar webview, backed
   entirely by LSP requests. Stated directly: **"Preview is the product.
   Everything else is supporting cast."**

8. **Dual MkDocs output — book and wiki modes** (req 98–109, §13)
   One source tree renders as a linear, nav-ordered book or a browsable,
   graph-oriented wiki (or both). This is the payoff of namespace-derived
   structure applied to a real static-site consumer.

9. **Namespace / tag orthogonality** (§8, req 56–61)
   Namespace = where a page lives (one, structural, filesystem-derived). Tag
   = what it's about (many, semantic, declared). The doc calls this
   orthogonality "load-bearing" — collapsing the two into one axis breaks
   both.

10. **Plugin purity declaration** (req 77–78, §12)
    Every plugin must declare whether its output is deterministic; strict
    mode refuses impure plugins. Guards P1 (determinism) against being
    silently broken by a single plugin's network call — flagged as a risk
    that "must exist from the first plugin, not be retrofitted."

---

## Notable exclusions

Left out of the top 10 despite appearing in the source, with reasons:

- **Redirects (19)** — potentially removes the need for stable artifact IDs
  (open question Q2), but its value is conditional on that question resolving
  in its favor.
- **Interactive graph views (90–92)** — significant scope (needs a second,
  JS-side renderer per §15's caveat) but downstream of namespaces/links, not
  foundational.
- **Callouts, footnotes, math, D2 diagrams (11–16)** — all "free" (come from
  existing Python-Markdown/MkDocs extensions), so they're low-risk but also
  not differentiating.
- **Health reports, backlinks, red links (25–32)** — valuable generated
  content, but derivative of namespaces + links rather than independent
  features.

See `initial_sketch.md` §19 for the suggested v0 slice, which is narrower
than this top-10 list (it defers templates, queries, the plugin API, wiki
mode, and the VS Code extension entirely).
