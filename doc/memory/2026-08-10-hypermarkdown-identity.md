# 2026-08-10 — the HyperMarkdown identity

A second pass over the project's name, taken days after
[HMD-0005](../proposals/HMD-0005/README.md) shipped the first one. Recorded here
because the decision is a convention rather than a code change, and because the
reason it is cheap now — and would not be later — is not derivable from either
the code or the git history.

## One spelling in prose, one in identifiers

- **`HyperMarkdown`** — capital `H`, capital `M`, lowercase `d` — is the name in
  specifications, documentation, and every other human-facing string.
- **`hypermarkdown`** is the name in package names, IDs, namespaces, keys, and
  domains.
- **`https://hypermarkdown.org`** is the canonical project website.
  `hyper-markdown.org` is the legacy address and is described that way, never as
  an alternative one.

This amends HMD-0005's D2 and D17, which fixed the prose spelling as
`HyperMarkDown` with an internal capital `D`. The identifier half of that
decision is untouched and was right; only the capitalisation of the display name
moves.

## The correction is worth making now precisely because it is small

The project is early enough that one identity can be carried forward instead of
two. Nothing that has been argued about the name gets cheaper by waiting — every
week adds documents, and eventually external links, that would have to be
reconciled or abandoned rather than re-spelled. The moment to settle an internal
capital is before anyone has read it often enough to have learned it.

What makes the timing genuinely favourable rather than merely early is the split
D2 made between the two spellings. **Nothing immutable carries the internal
capital.** The PyPI distribution, the npm scope, the extension publisher, the
Open VSX namespace, the MkDocs entry-point key, and the domain are all lowercase
already, and every one of them is a name that cannot be changed after the fact —
a published distribution name, a claimed namespace, a registered publisher. So
this is a pass over display strings and nothing else. Had prose and identifiers
shared one spelling, the same cosmetic correction would have been a second
abandon-and-republish on two registries, which is the trade HMD-0005's L1 records
as permanent.

Worth keeping for the next naming argument: separating the human name from the
machine name is what buys the right to change your mind about the human one.

## What follows mechanically, and what does not

The plugin class follows the prose. D20 resolved that `HyperMarkDownPlugin`
tracks the prose capitalisation rather than standing on its own, so the rule that
produced that symbol now produces `HyperMarkdownPlugin`. Both entry-point keys
are lowercase and unaffected, so the compatibility alias is not in play.

Two guards in `tests/test_docs.py` hardcode the old spelling and have to move in
the same commit as the prose. `SPEC_VERSION` parses the language's version out of
a sentence of the specification that contains the project's name — the fragility
`decisions.md` already flags under "Four versions", showing up for the second
time in four days — and `test_the_retired_name_is_gone` states the sanctioned
spelling in its own docstring.

The part that is easy to get wrong: **the retired-name guard does not catch
this.** Its pattern is `hyper[-_]markdown`, so what it recognises is the
*separator*. A surviving `HyperMarkDown` has none and is invisible to it, which
means the guard that found eleven wrong identifiers during the rename offers no
protection at all here. Enforcing the new spelling the way the old one is
enforced needs a second pattern — an internal capital `D` with no separator —
with its own allowlist, and that allowlist is not the same set as the existing
one.

## What keeps `HyperMarkDown` on purpose

Changelogs, for the reason L5 already gives: they record what a release was
called when it shipped, and re-spelling them would make them claim otherwise.
HMD-0005's record and tracker, which necessarily name every spelling they
discuss. And this memo.

The work itself — the README, the specification, and the remaining documentation
— is tracked in [the HMD-0005 tracker](../proposals/HMD-0005/STATUS.md), not
here.
