# HMD-0001: MVP — grammar, resolver, and `hmd lint`

**Status**: drafted
**Created**: 2026-07-31
**Source**: [Hypermarkdown — Requirements (Draft v0.1)](../../models/requirements/initial_sketch.md)

## Abstract

This proposal defines the hyper-markdown MVP: a normative grammar for the six
constructs the format owns (wikilinks, aliased links, heading links, block
anchors, block references, and the three embed forms), a deterministic
three-phase namespace resolver rooted at `doc/wiki` — an explicit import table,
then a non-recursive spine walk toward the root, then a single whole-tree
sweep — configured by a reserved frontmatter block carrying `tags`, per-card
`use` feature toggles, and Python-style `from … import … as …` bindings, with
the search strategy itself set once in `.hmd/config.toml`; plus a `hmd` Typer
CLI whose primary command is `hmd lint`. Everything the MkDocs and Python-Markdown
stack already provides — callouts, footnotes, math, D2, GFM baseline — is
consumed as a dependency and never reimplemented. A thin MkDocs plugin collects
`.hmd` files and rewrites resolved links so the format renders in book mode.
Queries, templates, inline properties, tags, the plugin API, wiki mode, and the
VS Code extension are all out of scope.

## Motivation

The source sketch holds ~110 requirements and is explicitly flagged as a
multi-year scope for a solo project (§18). Sequencing therefore matters more
than completeness, and §19 already names the smallest slice that demonstrates
the thesis. This proposal turns that slice into a specification concrete enough
to implement against:

- **Fix the grammar before anything consumes it.** Every downstream consumer —
  renderer, MkDocs plugin, future LSP — derives from one parse. Leaving the
  grammar informal guarantees drift the moment a second consumer appears.
- **Pin resolution semantics exactly.** Namespace-scoped resolution is the
  project's stated primary differentiator (§7). Its value is entirely in being
  predictable, so ambiguity handling and scope ordering must be normative, not
  emergent from an implementation.
- **Ship one useful command.** `hmd lint` is useful before rendering, queries,
  or templates exist, which lets the format be adopted one file at a time.
- **Buy, don't build, the free syntax.** Items 11–17 of the sketch are all
  provided by Python-Markdown and `pymdown-extensions`. Treating MkDocs as a
  source of free code rather than a build target keeps the MVP's own surface
  small.

**Risk called out by the source that this proposal must not defer:** determinism
(P1) is not recoverable once lost. The resolver and embed expander defined here
perform no network access, consult no clock, and impose an explicit ordering on
every step that could otherwise depend on filesystem iteration order.

## Goals

- A grammar for the build-time constructs, precise enough to write a
  conformance corpus against.
- A resolution algorithm that is deterministic, reports ambiguity as an error,
  and never escapes the namespace root.
- `hmd lint` with stable rule IDs, machine-readable output, and CI-usable exit
  codes.
- Dogfooding: `hmd lint doc/wiki` runs clean against this repository.

## Non-goals

- **Inline properties** (sketch 10), **named excerpts** (18), **redirects**
  (19), **parameterized transclusion** (20), **labels** (21), **tags** (56–61),
  **queries** (34–41), **templates** (79–86), and the **plugin API** (71–78).
- **Wiki mode** and generated content (24–33, 98–109). Book mode only.
- **The VS Code extension** (87–97) and **`hmd lsp`** (68). The architecture in
  §15 of the source stays the target; this proposal only avoids foreclosing it
  by keeping all semantics in library code rather than in the CLI layer.
- **Config file design.** The root marker and config schema (sketch 46, 70)
  are deferred to a later proposal; this proposal pins a default root and a
  CLI override so that work is not blocked.
- **The rest of the config schema.** `.hmd/config.toml` is read for exactly two
  settings (§5.3); everything else in sketch 70 is deferred.
- **Plugin toggles.** `use` is specified as the toggle mechanism, but the only
  feature it can name in the MVP is `autodiscovery`. Plugins themselves
  (sketch 71–78) are out of scope.
- **A general CommonMark parser.** See §1 and Open Questions.

## Specification

### 1. Parsing model

Hyper-markdown source is scanned, not fully parsed as CommonMark. The scanner
extracts only the constructs the format owns and leaves everything else to the
renderer.

- The scanner MUST mask the following regions before extracting any construct,
  so that their contents never yield links, embeds, or anchors: fenced code
  blocks (` ``` ` and `~~~`), indented code blocks, inline code spans, and HTML
  comments (`<!-- ... -->`).
- Masking MUST preserve byte offsets, so that every extracted construct carries
  an exact source span. Diagnostics are useless without precise positions, and
  a future LSP consumes the same spans.
- Every construct MUST record a `Span` of `(start_offset, end_offset, line,
  column)`, 1-indexed for line and column.
- The scanner MUST NOT depend on filesystem iteration order or on any state
  outside the file's own bytes. Cross-file concerns belong to the resolver.

The resulting `Document` model carries: `path`, `frontmatter`, `headings`,
`blocks`, `anchors`, `links`, and `embeds`.

**Known limitation.** A line-oriented masking scanner will diverge from
CommonMark on pathological input — for example a `[[link]]` inside an HTML
block, or a fence opened inside a blockquote. This is accepted for the MVP
because the construct set is small and the divergences are diagnosable; see
Open Questions.

### 2. Grammar

The constructs below are build-time: they are the format's own, and no existing
extension provides them.

```text
embed        := "!" wikilink
wikilink     := "[[" target [ "|" display ] "]]"
target       := page_ref [ fragment ]
page_ref     := absolute | relative | bare
absolute     := "/" segment { "/" segment }
relative     := ( "./" | "../" ) { segment | ".." } { "/" ( segment | ".." ) }
bare         := segment { "/" segment }
fragment     := "#" heading_text
              | "#^" block_id
segment      := 1*( any character except reserved )
display      := 1*( any character except "[" / "]" / newline )
block_id     := ALPHA / DIGIT *63( ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" )
```

- The **reserved character set** (sketch 112) inside `target` is exactly:
  `[`, `]`, `|`, `#`, `^`, and newline. These MUST NOT appear literally in a
  `segment`. No escape mechanism exists in the MVP; a target needing one of
  these characters is a malformed link (HMD010).
- A `page_ref` MAY carry a trailing `.hmd`; the resolver MUST strip it before
  matching. Writing the extension is redundant but harmless.
- `display` MAY be empty of meaning but MUST NOT be empty of characters — the
  form `[[Page|]]` is malformed (HMD010).
- **Block anchors** are a trailing `^block_id` at the end of a block's last
  line, preceded by at least one space and followed only by the line ending.
  The anchor and its leading whitespace are not part of the block's content.
- A `.hmd` file MAY carry **YAML frontmatter**: a `---` fence that MUST begin at
  byte 0 and MUST close with a `---` line. It MUST parse as YAML and MUST be a
  mapping at the top level (HMD009). Exactly three top-level keys are reserved
  for the toolchain — `tags`, `use`, and `import`, specified in §5.3; every
  other key stays user-owned and unexamined — the spec ships mechanisms, not
  vocabulary (P3) — but the whole mapping is exposed in the model and in
  `hmd graph` output.

**Explicitly excluded from the MVP grammar:** inline properties (`key:: value`),
highlights (`==text==`), and Mermaid. The first is deferred; the latter two are
rejected by the source.

### 3. Heading anchors

Heading fragments must agree with what the renderer emits, so anchor assignment
is delegated rather than invented.

- Heading slugs MUST be produced by Python-Markdown's `toc` slugify with `-` as
  the separator: `markdown.extensions.toc.slugify(text, "-")`.
- Collisions within one page MUST be deduplicated exactly as the `toc` extension
  does, by appending `_1`, `_2`, … in document order. `[[Page#Section]]`
  therefore addresses the first such heading and `[[Page#Section_1]]` the
  second. Reusing the renderer's rule is what keeps a link and its rendered
  destination from disagreeing.
- A `fragment` of the heading-text form MUST be matched by slugifying it and
  comparing to the page's assigned slugs. Both `[[Page#My Section]]` and
  `[[Page#my-section]]` therefore resolve to the same heading.

### 4. Namespace root

The namespace tree is a single rooted subtree; nothing outside it is
addressable.

- The project root is the nearest ancestor directory containing a `.hmd/`
  directory, falling back to the nearest containing `.git`. The namespace root
  is the `wiki` setting of `.hmd/config.toml` (§5.3), defaulting to `doc/wiki`.
  The existing wiki cards already treat the graph as closed to `doc/wiki`, so
  the default codifies current practice.
- `--root PATH` MUST override both on every command, naming the namespace root
  directly. The remainder of the config schema (sketch 70) stays deferred.
- Only files with the `.hmd` extension are members of the namespace tree. `.md`
  files under the root MUST be ignored: they are neither link targets nor lint
  inputs. This resolves source question Q5 for the MVP and lets
  `doc/wiki/README.md` remain a plain document.
- A resolved target MUST lie inside the root (HMD003). Path normalization MUST
  happen before the containment check, and symlinks MUST NOT be followed out of
  the root.

### 5. Link resolution

Resolution runs in two phases: a **spine walk** that is pure path arithmetic
from the source file outward to the root, and — only if that finds nothing — a
single **root sweep** that searches the whole tree once. The split exists
because the two phases answer different questions. The spine answers "what does
this name mean *here*," which must be predictable enough to hold in your head.
The sweep answers "does this name exist anywhere," which is a convenience and
is allowed to fail loudly.

#### 5.1 Binding a name in one directory

Both phases bind a name the same way, so folder notes work identically
everywhere.

```text
bind(dir, parts) -> Resolved(path) | NotFound

  file   := dir / join(parts) + ".hmd"
  folder := dir / join(parts)

  if file exists:                          return Resolved(file)
  if folder is a directory
     and folder/index.hmd exists:          return Resolved(folder/index.hmd)
  return NotFound
```

- A target naming a directory MUST resolve to that directory's `index.hmd`
  (sketch 52). `[[specs/auth]]` and `[[specs/auth/index]]` therefore address the
  same page, which is what makes a folder note the namespace's landing page
  rather than a file you have to name explicitly.
- If both `foo.hmd` and `foo/index.hmd` exist as siblings, the `.hmd` file wins
  and the pair is reported as HMD012. Resolution stays deterministic so later
  stages have something to work with, but the collision is a content bug: two
  files claim one name.

#### 5.2 The algorithm

```text
resolve(target, source, root) -> Resolved(path) | Unresolved | Ambiguous(paths) | Escapes

  stem  := target.page_ref with any ".hmd" suffix removed
  parts := stem split on "/"
  bindings := named_imports(source)                      # §5.3, name -> page
  paths    := wildcard_imports(source)                   # §5.3, ordered dirs
  mode     := discovery_mode(source)                     # §5.3

  1. ABSOLUTE — stem starts with "/"
       return bind(root, parts) or Unresolved

  2. RELATIVE — stem starts with "./" or "../"
       base := normalize(dirname(source) / stem)
       if base is outside root: return Escapes
       return bind(dirname(base), [basename(base)]) or Unresolved

  3. BARE — anything else

       # Phase 0 — named imports. The most explicit thing wins.
       if size(parts) == 1 and parts[0] in bindings:
           return Resolved(bindings[parts[0]])

       # Phase 1 — spine walk. Non-recursive, nearest first.
       spine := [dirname(source), parent(dirname(source)), ..., root]
       for dir in spine:
           r := bind(dir, parts)
           if r is Resolved: return r

       # Phase 2 — imported search paths, in declaration order.
       for dir in paths:
           r := bind(dir, parts)
           if r is Resolved: return r

       if mode == "spine": return Unresolved      # autodiscovery off

       # Phase 3 — autodiscovery. Runs at most once.
       if mode == "recursive":
           candidates := descendants(dirname(source), "*.hmd")
       else:                                      # mode == "both"
           candidates := descendants(root, "*.hmd")
       matches := { p in candidates
                    : relpath(p, root).without_suffix().parts ends with parts }
       if size(matches) == 1: return Resolved(the match)
       if size(matches) >  1: return Ambiguous(sorted(matches))
       return Unresolved
```

Phases 1 and 2 are the same probe over different origins: the spine supplies
origins the filesystem already implies, and `import` supplies origins the author
names. A card with imports is therefore not doing something exotic — it is
running the same nearest-first lookup against a longer list of directories.

- **Precedence follows explicitness**: a named import beats the spine, and the
  spine beats an imported search path. The ordering is not arbitrary. A named
  binding is the author pointing at one page, so it MUST be able to shadow a
  local card — that is what it is for. A wildcard import is bulk convenience, so
  it MUST NOT, and the resulting property is worth stating plainly: **adding a
  `import *` can only resolve links that were previously red; it can never
  change what an already-working link means.**
- The spine MUST be ordered from the source file's own directory outward to the
  root, inclusive of both ends, and each entry MUST be probed
  **non-recursively**. A bare name therefore means exactly *"an import, or here,
  or a folder above me"* — it can never reach sideways into a sibling namespace.
  This is the property that makes `[[logging]]` in `specs/billing/` mean the
  general card rather than whatever `specs/auth/` happens to contain.
- Imported search paths MUST be probed in declaration order, non-recursively.
  Where two imported paths both hold the name, the earlier declaration wins —
  this is ordering the author wrote, not a guess, but because it is easy to
  write by accident the shadowed candidate MUST be reported as HMD016.
- Phase 3 MUST run only when phases 1 and 2 found nothing, and MUST run only
  once. Every phase-3 match is off-spine and off-path by construction, so the
  phases can never disagree.
- In phase 3 **all matches rank equally**. A shallower match MUST NOT beat a
  deeper one, and more than one match is an error (HMD002), never a guess. This
  is the strictness principle (P2) made operational: the fix is to qualify the
  link, not to memorize a tie-break.
- `Ambiguous` results MUST list candidates sorted by their root-relative POSIX
  path, so diagnostics are byte-identical across platforms and runs (P1).
- An unresolved link is a **red link**, not a failure. It marks a page worth
  writing later, which is why HMD001 is a warning rather than an error.

#### 5.3 The frontmatter block

Configuration is two-level, and the levels answer different questions. A card
says **whether** a feature applies to it; the project config says **how** that
feature behaves. Splitting them this way keeps the algorithm uniform across a
tree — a reader never has to ask which search strategy a given card used — while
still letting any single card opt out.

```yaml
---
tags: [area/auth, status/accepted]

use: [autodiscovery]                    # per-card feature toggles

import:
  - from /shared import tokens as shared-tokens
  - from ../billing import invoices
  - from /glossary import *
---
```

Exactly three top-level keys are **reserved**: `tags`, `use`, and `import`. The
set is closed and enumerated here, so an author knows precisely which names are
taken; every other key stays user-owned and unexamined (P3).

##### `use` — per-card feature toggles

- `use` accepts a string or a list of strings. Each entry names a feature;
  prefixing `no_` disables it, in the manner of `vim`'s `set` / `set no…`.
  A feature not mentioned takes its project default.
- The only feature the MVP defines is **`autodiscovery`**: resolving a bare name
  by searching beyond the spine and the imported origins, i.e. phase 3 of §5.2.
  `use: no_autodiscovery` restricts a card to its imports and its spine, so
  every dependency it has is visible in the header or the link text.
- `use` is the extension point for the plugin toggles of sketch 71–78. Naming
  it now, with one core feature to prove the shape, is what keeps plugins from
  each inventing their own opt-in key later.
- **`use` inherits.** A `use` list in a folder's `index.hmd` applies to that
  folder's whole subtree; the nearest declaration wins, and a card overrides its
  folder. This is what makes a namespace a module rather than a naming
  convention.
- An unrecognized feature name MUST be rejected as HMD013 rather than ignored.
  Silently dropping a misspelled `no_autodiscovry` would hand the author the
  default while they believe they configured something else.

##### `import` — explicit name binding

`import` is a list of one-line statements in a pinned grammar, not nested YAML.
The statement form is readable at a glance and the grammar is trivial; nesting
the same information under `from:`/`names:` keys would cost more to read than
the mini-parser costs to write.

```text
import_stmt := "from" WS ref WS "import" WS import_list
import_list := "*" | binding *( "," WS binding )
binding     := name [ WS "as" WS alias ]
ref         := absolute | relative          ; §2 page_ref, never bare
name        := segment
alias       := segment
```

The two forms do different jobs, and the difference is the heart of the feature:

- **`from X import y as z`** binds one name. The local name `z` — or `y`, absent
  `as` — resolves to the page `X/y.hmd` and to nothing else.
- **`from X import *`** adds a search origin. `X` joins the list of directories
  a bare name is probed against, after the spine. It does **not** eagerly bind
  the directory's contents, so a card added to `X` later becomes reachable
  without editing the importing card.

The wildcard form is what the phrase "many spine runs" describes: instead of one
walk from here to the root, resolution probes a series of author-declared
origins with the same non-recursive `bind`.

- `ref` MUST be absolute or relative, never bare. A bare `ref` would need
  resolving by the very algorithm the import feeds, and that circularity has no
  good answer.
- An imported origin MUST be probed **non-recursively**, matching both the spine
  and Python's non-recursive `*`, so the reachable set stays legible from a
  directory listing.
- Named bindings apply only to **single-segment** bare targets. A binding names
  a page, not a namespace, so `[[z/child]]` is meaningless and falls through.
  Search origins have no such restriction: `[[auth/tokens]]` is probed against
  each origin as `origin/auth/tokens.hmd`.
- Two named bindings of the same local name MUST be rejected as HMD015.
  Last-wins, Python's answer, is exactly the guessing P2 forbids — and unlike
  the ordered-origin case there is no declaration order to appeal to, since both
  bindings claim the identical name outright.
- An import whose `ref` does not exist MUST be reported as HMD015 at the
  declaration, not deferred to the first use. A wrong import is a defect in the
  card's header regardless of whether the body happens to exercise it.
- A malformed statement MUST be reported as HMD014.
- **`import` does NOT inherit.** Unlike `use`, an import in `index.hmd` binds
  names for that file alone. Inherited bindings would make a bare name in a leaf
  card resolvable only by reading a file the author may never have opened —
  precisely the action-at-a-distance that imports exist to eliminate.

##### `tags` — the other axis

- `tags` is a list of strings; `/` separates hierarchy levels, so `area/backend`
  is a descendant of `area`. The MVP validates the shape and exposes the list in
  `hmd graph` output. A malformed value is HMD013.
- Tag **semantics** — generated tag pages, hierarchy queries, merging with
  inline `#tags` (sketch 56–61) — are deferred. Only the slot is pinned here, so
  that authors can start tagging against a stable shape.
- Tags never participate in link resolution. `[[...]]` answers *where a page
  lives*; a tag answers *what it is about*. `[[#area/auth]]` is malformed
  (HMD010), because `#` is reserved for fragments.

##### `.hmd/config.toml` — project policy

The `.hmd/` directory at the repository root doubles as the root marker (sketch
46). The MVP reads exactly two settings and ignores the rest of the file, so the
full schema stays deferred without blocking this work.

```toml
wiki = "doc/wiki"        # namespace root, relative to the repo root

[discovery]
mode = "both"            # both (default) | spine | recursive
```

- `mode` selects how a bare name is searched when autodiscovery is enabled:
  - **`both`** — the default. Spine walk, then a single sweep of the whole tree.
  - **`spine`** — spine walk only. Equivalent to `no_autodiscovery` everywhere,
    but stated once at the project level.
  - **`recursive`** — spine walk, then a sweep of the source's own subtree
    rather than the whole tree. Offered for trees that want discovery confined
    to a branch; it is not the default because a bare name that reaches
    downward but not upward surprises most authors.
- Mode is deliberately **not** settable per card. A tree where different cards
  resolve names by different algorithms cannot be read with confidence, and the
  per-card knob that does exist — `use` — is a toggle, which is safe precisely
  because it only ever *removes* reach.
- Absent `.hmd/config.toml`, the root is `doc/wiki` and the mode is `both`.

#### 5.4 Worked example

Given this tree:

```text
doc/wiki/                      ← namespace root
  index.hmd
  logging.hmd                  ← the general logging card
  specs/
    index.hmd
    auth/
      index.hmd
      login.hmd
      logging.hmd              ← auth-specific logging concerns
      tokens.hmd
    billing/
      index.hmd
      invoices.hmd
  shared/
    tokens.hmd
    retry-policy.hmd
```

| Written in | Link | Resolves to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` | `[[logging]]` | `specs/auth/logging.hmd` | spine, own folder |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[logging]]` | `logging.hmd` | spine walks past `specs/` to the root; never reaches into `auth/` |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` | `[[/logging]]` | `logging.hmd` | absolute, always the general card |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[retry-policy]]` | `shared/retry-policy.hmd` | nothing on the spine; sweep finds one match |
| `index.hmd` | `[[tokens]]` | **HMD002** | sweep matches `specs/auth/tokens.hmd` and `shared/tokens.hmd`; qualify it |
| `index.hmd` | `[[shared/tokens]]` | `shared/tokens.hmd` | spine, multi-segment |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` | `[[../billing/invoices]]` | `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | relative |
| `login.hmd` anywhere | `[[specs/auth]]` | `specs/auth/index.hmd` | folder note |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` | `[[/shared/tokens#Rotation\|how tokens rotate]]` | heading in `shared/tokens.hmd` | absolute + fragment + alias |
| under `use: no_autodiscovery` | `[[retry-policy]]` | red link (HMD001) | phase 3 disabled; import it or write `[[/shared/retry-policy]]` |

With an import in the header, the same card resolves names the tree cannot
supply on its own:

```yaml
---
tags: [area/billing]
import:
  - from /shared import tokens as shared-tokens
  - from /specs/auth import tokens as auth-tokens
---
```

| Written in | Link | Resolves to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[shared-tokens]]` | `shared/tokens.hmd` | phase 0, aliased binding |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[auth-tokens]]` | `specs/auth/tokens.hmd` | phase 0; both `tokens` cards now reachable, unambiguously |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[tokens]]` | **HMD002** | unchanged — importing under aliases binds neither card to the bare name |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` + `from / import logging` | `[[logging]]` | `logging.hmd` | phase 0 beats the spine's own-folder `specs/auth/logging.hmd` |

That last row is the named-binding rule doing its job: the card explicitly asked
for the general logging page and got it, in a folder where the bare name means
something else.

The wildcard form instead lengthens the list of places a name is looked for:

```yaml
---
import:
  - from /shared import *
---
```

| Written in | Link | Resolves to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[retry-policy]]` | `shared/retry-policy.hmd` | phase 2, imported origin — no sweep needed |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[tokens]]` | `shared/tokens.hmd` | phase 2 resolves it, so phase 3 never runs and HMD002 never fires |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` | `[[tokens]]` | `specs/auth/tokens.hmd` | spine wins; the import cannot redirect a working local link |

The second and third rows together are the monotonicity property: `import *`
turned an ambiguous name into a resolved one for the billing card without
touching what that same name means next door in `auth`.

The two dimensions stay orthogonal throughout. `[[...]]` navigates
**structure** — where a page lives, one answer, derived from disk. Tags
(sketch 56–61, deferred) navigate **topic** — what a page is about, many
answers, declared in content, cutting across folders. A tag MUST NOT be a
wikilink target: `[[#area/auth]]` is malformed (HMD010), because `#` is
reserved for fragments. Keeping tags out of the link grammar now is what leaves
room for them later.

### 6. Embed expansion

Embeds are expanded by the same resolver, with an explicit bound on recursion.

- `![[Page]]` MUST expand to the target's full body with its frontmatter fence
  removed.
- `![[Page#Section]]` MUST expand to the matched heading and every subsequent
  line up to, but excluding, the next heading of the same or higher level.
- `![[Page#^id]]` MUST expand to the anchored block with the trailing ` ^id`
  marker stripped.
- Expansion MUST be recursive: embeds inside expanded content are themselves
  expanded.
- The expander MUST maintain a stack of `(resolved_path, fragment)` pairs.
  Re-entering a pair already on the stack is a cycle (HMD007).
- Maximum expansion depth is **16**. Exceeding it is HMD008. The limit is deep
  enough for legitimate composition and shallow enough to bound work on
  adversarial input; per sketch 85 it is a single shared constant, to be reused
  by the template engine when that arrives rather than reimplemented beside it.
- The MVP MUST NOT shift heading levels in embedded content. Level shifting
  changes document outlines and deserves its own decision; leaving it out keeps
  expansion textual and reversible.

### 7. `hmd` CLI

A Typer application exposing the library. All semantics live in the library;
the CLI is argument parsing and formatting only, so a future `hmd lsp` shares
one implementation (P5).

- **`hmd lint [PATH]...`** — parse, resolve, report. This is the MVP's
  acceptance gate. With no paths, it MUST lint the entire namespace tree.
- **`hmd graph [--format json]`** — dump the resolved graph: nodes with
  frontmatter and headings, edges with kind (`link` or `embed`) and source span.
- **`hmd render PATH [--to markdown|html]`** — expand embeds and rewrite
  resolved links. `markdown` emits flat markdown; `html` runs the
  Python-Markdown pipeline of §8.

Deferred to later proposals: `hmd query`, `hmd serve`, `hmd lsp`.

Every command MUST accept `--root PATH` and `--format text|json`, and JSON
output MUST be identical in content to the text output so CI and a future editor
client consume the same data (sketch 69).

**Exit codes** are pinned:

- `0` — completed with no errors; warnings MAY be present
- `1` — at least one error; under `--strict`, at least one warning
- `2` — usage error, unreadable root, or internal failure

### 8. Lint rules

Rule IDs are stable and MUST NOT be renumbered once released; suppression
comments and CI configuration will reference them.

| ID | Severity | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HMD001 | warning | Link target does not resolve (red link) |
| HMD002 | error | Bare link matches more than one page in the root sweep |
| HMD003 | error | Link resolves outside the namespace root |
| HMD004 | error | Heading fragment not present in the resolved page |
| HMD005 | error | Block id not present in the resolved page |
| HMD006 | error | Duplicate block anchor id within one page |
| HMD007 | error | Embed cycle |
| HMD008 | error | Embed depth limit (16) exceeded |
| HMD009 | error | Frontmatter is not valid YAML, or not a top-level mapping |
| HMD010 | error | Malformed wikilink or embed syntax |
| HMD011 | warning | Two headings in one page share a slug |
| HMD012 | error | A page and a folder note claim the same name (`foo.hmd` beside `foo/index.hmd`) |
| HMD013 | error | Unrecognized feature in `use`, or malformed `tags` value |
| HMD014 | error | Malformed `import` statement |
| HMD015 | error | Import `ref` does not resolve, or two named imports bind the same local name |
| HMD016 | warning | A bare name matched two imported search paths; the earlier declaration won |

- `--strict` MUST promote every warning to an error. It MUST NOT change which
  diagnostics are produced, only how they are counted — a strict run and a
  normal run over the same tree differ in exit code alone.
- Each diagnostic MUST carry `rule`, `severity`, `path` (root-relative, POSIX
  separators), `line`, `column`, `message`, and for HMD002 the sorted candidate
  list.
- Diagnostics MUST be emitted sorted by `(path, line, column, rule)`.

### 9. MkDocs integration

MkDocs is consumed for the code it already provides. The plugin's whole job is
to make `.hmd` visible to a build and to rewrite what the resolver has already
decided.

- The plugin MUST register `.hmd` files through an `on_files` hook, because
  MkDocs matches a fixed extension set that does not include `.hmd`.
- A Python-Markdown extension MUST rewrite resolved wikilinks to relative
  anchors and expand embeds, reusing §5 and §6 rather than re-resolving.
- Unresolved links MUST render as red links — an `<a>` carrying a
  `class="hmd-redlink"` — rather than being dropped or raising. This keeps a
  build green while the lint output tracks the work item.
- **Book mode only.** Nav-ordered linear output. Wiki mode, backlinks, category
  pages, and special pages are out of scope.

These extensions are enabled by the plugin and are the "free" half of the
format's syntax (sketch 11–17): `admonition`, `pymdownx.details`, `footnotes`,
`pymdownx.arithmatex`, `toc`, `tables`, `pymdownx.superfences`,
`pymdownx.tasklist`, `pymdownx.tilde`. `mkdocs-d2-plugin` is an optional extra
rather than a hard dependency, since it shells out to the `d2` binary.

## Backwards Compatibility

Nothing is released, so there is no API to break. Two content-level notes:

- [`doc/wiki/hyper-markdown.hmd`](../../wiki/hyper-markdown.hmd) describes
  resolution as "by filename alone, anywhere under `doc/wiki/`". The root sweep
  of §5.2 preserves that exactly for every uniquely-named card, so no existing
  link changes meaning. What §5 adds is a spine that gets first say — so a
  nearer card now wins over a distant one — and HMD002 in place of an arbitrary
  pick when two cards share a name. That card should be updated to describe both
  phases once this proposal is accepted.
- `doc/wiki/README.md` stays a plain markdown file and is invisible to the
  resolver per §4.

## Security Considerations

The MVP reads local files and writes to stdout, but it is a parser and parsers
receive untrusted input.

- Path traversal is the primary surface. Every resolved path MUST be normalized
  and containment-checked against the root (§4), and symlinks MUST NOT be
  followed out of the root. `[[../../../../etc/passwd]]` is HMD003.
- An `import` statement's `ref` is a second traversal surface and MUST take the
  same containment check before the directory is read;
  `from ../../../../etc import passwd` is HMD003, not HMD015. A wildcard import
  reads a directory listing, so an unchecked `ref` would disclose filenames
  outside the tree even when no page resolves.
- Resource exhaustion is bounded by the depth limit of 16 and by cycle
  detection (§6). A tree of mutually embedding pages MUST terminate with HMD007
  rather than exhausting memory.
- YAML MUST be loaded with `yaml.safe_load`. `yaml.load` on untrusted
  frontmatter is arbitrary object construction.
- No command in the MVP performs network access (P1). `mkdocs-d2-plugin` shells
  out to `d2`, which is why it is an optional extra and not a dependency of the
  core.

## Deployment / Activation

Green-field implementation, ordered so that each milestone is independently
testable:

1. **M1 — model and scanner.** `Span`, `Document`, masking scanner, frontmatter,
   headings, anchors, link and embed extraction. Corpus fixtures for §2 and §3.
2. **M2 — resolver.** Namespace root discovery, the §5.2 two-phase algorithm,
   folder-note binding, the frontmatter block (`tags`/`use`/`import`), `use`
   inheritance, `.hmd/config.toml` reading, containment checks.
3. **M3 — `hmd lint`.** All sixteen rules, text and JSON reporters, exit codes,
   `--strict`. Gate: `hmd lint doc/wiki` exits 0 on this repository.
4. **M4 — expansion and secondary commands.** Embed expander with cycle and
   depth handling, `hmd render`, `hmd graph`.
5. **M5 — MkDocs plugin.** `on_files` collection, the link/embed
   Python-Markdown extension, book-mode build of `doc/wiki`.

Only M1–M3 are required to call the MVP done; M4 and M5 are included because
they reuse M1–M2 wholesale and validate the model against a second consumer.

## Test Plan

Unit tests MUST include:

- Masking: `[[x]]` inside a fence, an indented block, a code span, and an HTML
  comment yields no link, and offsets after the masked region stay exact.
- Grammar: each production in §2 at its boundaries — empty display, reserved
  characters in a target, a 64-character block id, a 65-character one.
- Slugs: heading collisions produce `_1`/`_2` in document order, and both
  `#My Section` and `#my-section` reach the same heading.
- Resolution: absolute, relative, and bare forms; a nearer spine entry wins over
  a farther one; a bare name never reaches sideways into a sibling namespace
  (the `specs/billing` → `logging` case of §5.4); the sweep resolves a unique
  off-spine match and raises HMD002 with a sorted candidate list on two;
  `../` escaping the root raises HMD003.
- Folder notes: `[[specs/auth]]` and `[[specs/auth/index]]` resolve to the same
  page; `foo.hmd` beside `foo/index.hmd` raises HMD012 and resolves to the file.
- Discovery: `use: no_autodiscovery` suppresses phase 3; a `use` list in a
  folder's `index.hmd` governs its whole subtree and a card overrides its
  folder; `mode = "spine"` and `mode = "recursive"` each change phase 3 as
  specified; an unrecognized feature name raises HMD013.
- Named imports: `as` aliasing binds the alias and not the original name; a
  named import beats a same-named card on the spine; a bare `ref`, two bindings
  of one local name, and a non-existent `ref` raise HMD014/HMD015/HMD015
  respectively; an import in `index.hmd` does not bind names for sibling cards.
- Wildcard imports: an origin is probed after the whole spine and never
  recurses; a card added to an imported directory becomes reachable with no
  edit to the importing card; two origins holding one name resolve to the
  earlier declaration and raise HMD016; and the monotonicity property holds —
  adding `import *` to a card MUST NOT change any link that already resolved.
- Frontmatter: `tags` shape validation, and a user-owned key with an unusual
  name passes through to `hmd graph` untouched.
- Expansion: section embed stops at the next same-or-higher heading; a two-page
  embed cycle raises HMD007; a 17-deep chain raises HMD008.
- Every lint rule fires on a minimal positive case and stays silent on a
  minimal negative one.

Integration tests MUST include:

- A **conformance corpus** (sketch 111) at `tests/corpus/<case>/`, each case
  holding an input tree and an `expected.json` of diagnostics and resolutions.
  Corpus cases are the executable spec; a grammar change that does not update a
  fixture is a bug.
- Determinism: linting the same tree twice, and linting it with the files
  created in a different order, MUST produce byte-identical JSON.
- A MkDocs build of `doc/wiki` succeeding with `.hmd` pages present in the
  output and red links carrying `class="hmd-redlink"`.

```bash
python -m pytest
hmd lint doc/wiki --format json
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Open Questions

These MUST be resolved before this record moves from drafted to accepted.

- Should the scanner move to a CommonMark block parser (for example
  `markdown-it-py`, which carries source maps) once the corpus exposes real
  divergences, and does that second markdown engine conflict with P5?
- Does `use` apply to a page's *own* links only, or also to links inside content
  that page embeds from elsewhere? §6 expansion is textual, so today the
  embedded page's own toggles and imports govern — is that the right default?
- Should an imported search path be probed *before* the spine rather than after?
  §5.2 pins "after" to buy monotonicity — an `import *` can never redirect a
  working link — but an author who imports a namespace precisely to override
  local names has only the named form available.
- Should `hmd graph` record each card's resolved search path (spine entries plus
  imported origins), so a consumer can see what a card can reach without
  replaying the algorithm?
- Should `use` support project-wide defaults in `.hmd/config.toml` — a
  `[features]` table — or does that reintroduce the "which strategy did this
  card use" ambiguity that keeping `mode` project-only was meant to avoid?
- Should the root sweep be bounded (page count, or a depth cap) so that a large
  tree cannot make an unresolvable bare link expensive to diagnose?
- Should the MVP ship a suppression mechanism (`<!-- hmd-disable HMD001 -->`),
  or does adding one before real usage risk designing it wrong?
- Is `.hmd` → `page/index.html` or `.hmd` → `page.html` the right MkDocs URL
  shape, and does that choice constrain the relative anchors §9 emits?
- Does `hmd render --to markdown` guarantee a round trip, or is flat markdown a
  one-way build product?

Deliberately left to later proposals rather than resolved here: the config
schema and root marker (sketch 46, 70), stable IDs versus redirects (Q2), named
excerpts versus block anchors (Q3), and the query grammar (Q6).

## Changelog

- 2026-07-31: drafted
- 2026-07-31: §5 reworked from recursive-per-scope to the two-phase spine walk
  plus single root sweep; folder-note binding added (HMD012); worked example
  added as §5.4
- 2026-07-31: frontmatter block specified (§5.3) — reserved `tags`, `use`, and
  `import` top-level keys replacing the earlier nested `hmd:` profile; `use`
  introduced as an inheriting per-card feature toggle with `autodiscovery` as
  its first feature; `from … import … as …` promoted from deferred to
  specified, becoming resolution phase 0; search strategy moved to
  `.hmd/config.toml` `[discovery] mode`, whose directory now doubles as the
  root marker; HMD013–HMD015 added
- 2026-07-31: `import *` respecified as a search origin rather than an eager
  name binding — resolution now probes the spine and then each imported origin
  with the same non-recursive step; precedence pinned as named import > spine >
  imported origin, giving the monotonicity property; HMD016 added
