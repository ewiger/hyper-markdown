# HMD-0001 — Worked examples

Companion to [HMD-0001](README.md). Everything here illustrates the
specification; where the two disagree, the specification wins.

The tree under [`examples/small/`](../../../examples/small/) is a runnable
fixture, not a listing invented for this document. It is self-contained — its
own `.hmd/config.toml` makes it a project root — so it can be linted directly:

```bash
hmd lint --root examples/small
```

It MUST lint with zero errors. Exactly one warning is expected and deliberate:
the red link `[[idempotency]]` in `glossary/index.hmd`.

## The tree

```text
examples/small/
  .hmd/config.toml             ← root marker + project policy
  index.hmd                    ← root folder note
  logging.hmd                  ← the general logging card
  glossary/
    index.hmd
    token.hmd                  ← ^definition anchor
  shared/
    index.hmd
    tokens.hmd                 ← ^rotation-window anchor
    retry-policy.hmd           ← ^backoff-formula anchor, math, footnote
  specs/
    index.hmd
    auth/
      index.hmd
      login.hmd                ← imports, embeds, callout, d2, task list
      logging.hmd              ← shadows /logging on the spine
      tokens.hmd               ← shares a bare name with shared/tokens.hmd
    billing/
      index.hmd                ← use: [no_autodiscovery], inherited
      invoices.hmd             ← wildcard import + relative named import
```

## Resolution

### Spine and sweep

| Written in | Link | Resolves to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `specs/auth/login.hmd` | `[[logging]]` | `specs/auth/logging.hmd` | spine, own folder |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[logging]]` | `logging.hmd` | spine walks past `specs/` to the root; never reaches into `auth/` |
| `specs/auth/logging.hmd` | `[[/logging]]` | `logging.hmd` | absolute — required here, since the bare name is this very card |
| `index.hmd` | `[[invoices]]` | `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | nothing on the spine; sweep finds one match |
| `index.hmd` | `[[tokens]]` | **HMD002** | sweep matches `specs/auth/tokens.hmd` and `shared/tokens.hmd` |
| `index.hmd` | `[[shared/tokens]]` | `shared/tokens.hmd` | spine, multi-segment |
| `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` | `[[../auth/login]]` | `specs/auth/login.hmd` | relative |
| anywhere | `[[specs/auth]]` | `specs/auth/index.hmd` | folder note |
| `glossary/index.hmd` | `[[idempotency]]` | red link (HMD001) | no card claims the name; a work item, not a failure |

The second row is the reason the spine is probed non-recursively. A bare name
means *"here, or a folder above me"* and can never reach sideways into a sibling
namespace, so billing gets the general logging card rather than whatever
`specs/auth/` happens to contain.

The fifth row is why `index.hmd` never writes `[[tokens]]`: two cards claim the
name, neither is on that file's spine, and the sweep therefore finds both. The
fix is qualification, not a tie-break.

### Named imports

`specs/auth/login.hmd` declares:

```yaml
import:
  - from /shared import tokens as shared-tokens
  - from /glossary import *
```

| Link | Resolves to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[[shared-tokens]]` | `shared/tokens.hmd` | phase 0, aliased binding |
| `[[tokens]]` | `specs/auth/tokens.hmd` | phase 1 — importing under an alias leaves the bare name alone |
| `[[token]]` | `glossary/token.hmd` | phase 2, through the imported origin |
| `[[retry-policy#Backoff]]` | `shared/retry-policy.hmd` | phase 3 — on no spine entry and in no import |

The second row is the point of aliasing. Both `tokens` cards are reachable from
this one card, unambiguously, because only one of them claims the bare name.

A named import may shadow the spine, and that is deliberate — it is the one
mechanism that can. Had `login.hmd` written `from / import logging`, its
`[[logging]]` would resolve to the general card instead of the sibling one.

### Wildcard imports

`specs/billing/invoices.hmd` declares:

```yaml
import:
  - from /shared import *
  - from ../auth import login as login-spec
```

| Link | Resolves to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[[retry-policy]]` | `shared/retry-policy.hmd` | phase 2, imported origin — no sweep needed |
| `[[login-spec]]` | `specs/auth/login.hmd` | phase 0, relative named import |
| `[[index]]` | `specs/billing/index.hmd` | phase 1, own folder note |

`import *` adds a **search origin**; it does not eagerly bind the directory's
contents. A card added to `shared/` later becomes reachable from here with no
edit to this header.

Because imported origins are probed *after* the whole spine, adding an
`import *` is monotonic: it can resolve links that were previously red, but it
can never change what an already-working link means. `[[tokens]]` written in
`specs/auth/` still means the auth card even if that namespace later imports
`/shared`.

## Configuration

`specs/billing/index.hmd` declares `use: [no_autodiscovery]`. Because `use`
inherits, that governs `invoices.hmd` too, and the whole billing namespace
resolves through imports and the spine only.

It also overrides `.hmd/config.toml`, which enables autodiscovery for the rest
of the tree — frontmatter always beats configuration:

```text
1. the card's own `use`                        ← billing/invoices.hmd, inherited
2. `use` in the nearest ancestor index.hmd     ← billing/index.hmd
3. [discovery] autodiscovery in config.toml    ← true, for everything else
4. the built-in default                        ← ON
```

The practical difference shows up in one line of each card. `login.hmd` reaches
`retry-policy` by sweep and says nothing about it; `invoices.hmd` reaches the
same card only because its header names `/shared`. The second style costs a line
of frontmatter and buys a dependency list you can read without running the
resolver.

## Syntax coverage

| Feature | Sketch | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wikilink | 1 | everywhere |
| Aliased link | 2 | `logging.hmd`, `specs/auth/logging.hmd` |
| Heading link | 3 | `shared/tokens.hmd` → `[[retry-policy#Backoff]]` |
| Block anchor | 4 | `^correlation-id`, `^definition`, `^rotation-window`, `^backoff-formula` |
| Block reference | 5 | `specs/billing/invoices.hmd` |
| Note embed | 6 | — *(no card embeds a whole page; see below)* |
| Section embed | 7 | `specs/auth/logging.hmd` → `![[/logging#Redaction]]` |
| Block embed | 8 | `specs/auth/login.hmd` → `![[token#^definition]]` |
| Frontmatter | 9 | every card |
| Callouts | 11 | `logging.hmd`, `specs/auth/login.hmd` |
| Comments | 12 | `specs/auth/login.hmd` — masking demo, holds a `[[link]]` that is not a link |
| Footnotes | 13 | `shared/retry-policy.hmd` |
| Inline math | 14 | `shared/retry-policy.hmd`, `specs/auth/login.hmd` |
| Display math | 15 | `shared/retry-policy.hmd`, `specs/auth/login.hmd` |
| D2 diagram | 16 | `specs/auth/login.hmd` |
| GFM baseline | 17 | table in `logging.hmd`, task list in `specs/auth/login.hmd` |
| Folder notes | 52 | every `index.hmd` |
| Red links | 28 | `glossary/index.hmd` |

Whole-page embed (`![[Page]]`) is absent on purpose: in a tree this small every
card is short enough that transcluding one entire would read as duplication
rather than composition, which would misrepresent what the feature is for. The
conformance corpus covers it instead.

## What this tree does not cover

- **Tags** beyond the `tags:` key itself. Tag pages, hierarchy queries, and
  inline `#tag` syntax are deferred (sketch 56–61); only the frontmatter slot is
  pinned by HMD-0001.
- **Error cases.** Every diagnostic except HMD001 is absent by construction,
  since the tree is meant to lint clean. HMD002, HMD012, and HMD014–HMD016
  belong in the conformance corpus, which pairs bad input with expected
  diagnostics.
- **Book and wiki output.** The tree is a resolver fixture; rendering it through
  the MkDocs plugin is M5 work.
