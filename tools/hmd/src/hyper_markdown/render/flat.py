"""Flat markdown: erasure of the hyper-markdown layer (HMD-0002 §5).

Every embed is inlined and every resolved link becomes an ordinary relative
markdown link, leaving output that GitHub or a plain renderer reads without
knowing the format exists. This is a one-way build product. The output no longer
records where a link came from — spine, named import, or sweep — and no longer
marks where an embedded card began and ended.

An unresolved link is left as written. There is nothing to erase it to, and a
`[[name]]` surviving in the output is a truthful statement that the page does
not exist yet.
