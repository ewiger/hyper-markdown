"""Embed expansion (HMD-0001 §6).

Expansion is textual: an embed is replaced by the target's bytes, with no
heading-level shifting, so the operation stays reversible by inspection. It is
bounded in two ways — a stack of `(path, fragment)` pairs catches cycles, and
`MAX_EMBED_DEPTH` bounds work on adversarial input.

The expander is total. An embed it cannot expand — unresolved, cyclic, or too
deep — is left in the output exactly as written, and the reason is returned as a
diagnostic. A build stays green while lint tracks the work item.
